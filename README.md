# Hackathon - Deployed Full Stack Challenge 💪🏆🪝

Your challenge is to ideate, plan, and build a full stack app that includes the requirements below. You can use this repository for your front end. For your back end, one person in your team can create another repository for the back end and add your pair/team as contributors. (Pop a link to your team's back end repository in this readme.)

What you build is up to you - use the steps that we've learned throughout the course to ensure your MVP is well-planned and managable for a day-long project (with a list of stretch goals to dip into as well!).

Start simple and get your first iteration MVP of your app working as your first priority, and then iterate!

## Requirements

- Deployed front and back ends that talk to each other
- Use of the `useContext` hook somewhere in your app
- Use of at least one custom hook somewhere in your app
